# Saving Trees

## Purpose

When learning new material, I often reinforce my understanding by summarizing the new found knowledge in my own words. Understanding the purpose behind subjects helps me make use of the material at hand. Unfortunately I find that I gravitate towards writing my notes in spiral paper notebooks. I have piles of spiral paper notebooks which makes referencing older material an extremely difficult task. No matter how orderly I make my notes and organize my materials, it is a slow inefficient, dreary task to refer to my documentation.

**Consequently** I have decided to undertake the task of converting my notes from paper pages to web pages, thus "**Saving Trees**". And while this endeavor might might not save any rain forest's it will at least make my notes more accessible and helpful.
