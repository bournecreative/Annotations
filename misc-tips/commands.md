## Differences with NPM commands

Install globally on your computer. The install globally when we want to run package from the terminal 

```
npm install [package] -g
```

install dependency only for development

```
npm install [package] --save-dev
```

install dependency for both development and user

```text
npm install [package] 
```

Installing a specific version of a package

```text
npm install [package]@2.2.0
```

### Show list of npm dependences with your version and latest version 

```text
npm outdated
```

Updating to latest version

```text
npm update
```

## Common Bash Commands

```text
ls               // list files
ls -a            //list all files

mkdir            // make directory

touch            // creates a file within present directory

cp [file path]   // copies files
Example would copy file from given directory and drop it in the root of directory
cp node_modules/laravel-mix/setup/webpack.mix.js ./

rm [file/folder] // removes file or folder

```
