# Commands

## Differences with NPM commands

Install globally on your computer. The install globally when we want to run package from the terminal 

```
npm install [package] -g
```

install dependency only for development

```
npm install [package] --save-dev
```

install dependency for both development and user

```text
npm install [package] 
```

Installing a specific version of a package

```text
npm install [package]@2.2.0
```

### Bash Commands

```text
ls               // list files
mkdir            // make directory
touch            // creates a file within present directory
cp [file path]   // copies files 
rm [file/folder] // removes file or folder 
```
