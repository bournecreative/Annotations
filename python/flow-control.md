# Flow Control

## Introducing Flow Control

**If/else:** Execute a block of code when a condition is true. You can have multiple conditions and outcomes.

```text
var secret = 'Chronos'

if len(secret) <= 5:
    // Indentation is important or code will not run
    print('secret is too short')
else:
    print('secret is a good lenth')
```

```text
var gummyBearWeight = 10

if gummyBearWeight < 1:
    print('dont be shy, get more gummies')
elif gummyBearWeight <= 10:
    print('make sure you share')
else: 
    print('Save some for the others')
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Conditions can be compounded with 'and'

**elif** gummyBearWeight &gt;= 10 and gummyBearWeight &lt; 20:
{% endhint %}

```text
Identifying whether a value is present
listOfFiles = [ ]

if listOfFiles:
    print('files found')
else:
    print('no files found')
```

**For loops:** Logic repeats for a set number of intervals

```text

```

**While Loops:** Logic repeats while a condition is true

```text

```
