# Overview

## Visualizing the Git Workflow

Once we initialize a folder with the "_**init git**_" command, git begins watching the files in our local directory or "**working directory**". 

1. Changes made within the working directory as not yet "tracked" until they are added to the "**staging area or staging index**". 
2. Once changes are staged, changes can be committed to the repository. Changes are now tracked by Git!
